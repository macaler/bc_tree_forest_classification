    "This project is the fourth in a series of small toy projects I undertook to get more practice with the machine learning techniques I learned about on Codecademy. In it, I shall revisit the data I used in my first toy project; in that project, I used logistic regression to predict if a cell whose digitized image was analyzed is benign or malignant. I used the Scikit-Learn breast cancer data set to complete that project, and I plan to use that data set again to complete this one. The goal will again be to predict if a cell whose digitized image was analyzed is benign or malignant, but now I am going to use both a single decision tree classifier and a random forest classifier to do the prediction. This way, I will be able to compare the performance of the tree and forest with each other, and with my previous logistic regression results. It will be interesting to see which technique yields the most accurate predictions!\n",

    "Decision tree classifiers aim to split input data into smaller subsets based on input features, one at a time. That is to say, single decision trees look at one particular data feature, split the input data into subsets based on that feature, and repeat that process until the smallest, purest subsets possible have been reached. As I understand it (and which makes sense based on how decision trees are constructed), single decision trees are prone to overfitting. Random forest classification, on the other hand, involves averaging over a large number of decision tree classifiers to try and improve model accuracy and reduce the possible effects of overfitting the data. What does it mean for a model to be overfit? As I understand it, overfitting means that a model is too dependent on the training set \"fed\" to it -- and so too dependent on any small-scale trends in such a training set -- so if a new set of data comes along which better reflects large-scale trends in the data, the model has a hard time making predictions. Since the breast cancer data set isn't very large, the training set I give it will also not be very large, so there is a good possibility that the model will \"learn\" particular nuances which aren't as prominant in the larger data set. Those nuances will also vary a bit with which precise cells end up in the training set vs. the test set. Thus, I expect a random forest classifier fit to the breast cancer data will fare better than a single decision tree classifier. But will either of them outperform my logistic regression model in terms of accuracy of predictions? There is only one way to find out: Fit the models and get the numbers!\n",

Further, since I can keep track of how many test/validation data points were actually classified as \"malignant\" (or \"benign\"), I can count up the number of correct classifications the model made, and the number of incorrect classifications it made, and dump the result into one compact data structure. Actually, I should be more careful to say that Python and Scikit-Learn's confusion_matrix() function is capable of keeping track of these things; I do a similar accounting below, but for the purposes of making a bar plot. In any event, let's have a look at the confusion matrix for my single tree classification model:"

But what about that confusion matrix? Let's look at the first row first. The first row corresponds to label 0, or malignant cells. There were a total of 42 malignant cells in the test/validation set. Of those, the single decision tree model classified 36 of them as 0 (i.e., malignant), and 6 of them as 1 (i.e., benign). So, the model misclassified a total of 6 malignant cells. The second row of the confusion matrix corresponds to label 1, or benign cells. There were a total of 72 benign cells in the test/validation set. Of those, the single decision tree model classified one cell as 0 (i.e., malignant) and 71 cells as 1 (i.e., benign). Thus, the model misclassified only 1 benign cell.

    "While it's nice to have the confusion matrix for more detailed information, this gives a great visual overview of overall model performance. It's clear from the bar plot that the random forest model classified more cells successfully, and had fewer failed classifications; it's also clear that the single tree model's performance wasn't that much worse, as the heights of both sets of bars aren't vastly dissimilar. Thus, we see visually that the random forest classification model had the higher accuracy, but not by much.\n",

    "But what if I want to look at the results for each cell in the test/validation set individually? There aren't that many -- only 114 -- so this isn't infeasible. I'm going to try something here that I did for my wine recognition classification project: namely, I'm going to plot, for each cell in the test/validation set, its true classification in grey, its single tree model predicted classification in red, and its random forest model predicted classification in blue. I'll use different symbols in an attempt to make each classification distinct in the plot below, as there will be 100+ overlaps of all three classifications. Fortunately, there are only two classification choices here: 0 for malignant and 1 for benign, so the vertical axis of the plot won't need to be very large. If I make the plot very wide, but very short, I should be able to see some detail in each data point. On the horizontal axis I will just plot the cell's \"ID\" in the test/validation set, which is just its index in the test array (i.e., an \"ID\" of 0 for the first cell, 1 for the second, and so on)."

    "Well, so far, neither my single decision tree classifier nor my random forest classifier has outperformed my logistic regression model of the Scikit-Learn breast cancer data in terms of accuracy. But, could I improve the accuracy of my tree and forest classifiers by carefully choosing a few features to leave out? I did that for the logistic regression model, and while I was unable to improve accuracy by doing so I was able to find a subset of features that yielded the same model accuracy (but with less input data). What if I do the same here? Could I get either/both of my single tree and/or random forest classifiers to perform at least as well as the logistic regression classifier? There's only one way to find out: try it!\n",

I have a list of those features from my logistic regression model Jupyter Notebook, so I'll copy them over here, run both a single decision tree classifier and a random forest classifier for this set of features, and see if there is a resulting improvement in model accuracy score."

But could I, by carefully choosing more features to neglect, build models with even better performance? Or at the very least, could I build models with a minimum number of features which at least didn't result in a worse accuracy score?\n",

    "I set about answering those questions. I had originally hypothesized that there would be a slightly different set of optimum features for the single tree and random forest classification models, but that turned out not to be the case. While I cannot pretend to have investigated every conceivable combination of input features, I was able to come up with a set that boosted the single tree classification model accuracy to match that of the random forest classification model, and simultaneously did not result in a decreased model accuracy for the random forest classification model. This seems to be the best I can do for the machine learning algorithms I am trying to implement for this particular splitting of training/test data for this particular data set.\n",

No texture, no symmetry, no compactness; just how big is it, what is the radius, what are the concave points, and what is that concavity. I don't know anywhere near enough about the topic to say whether that indicates anything profound or not, it just struck me as interesting as I go about building toy machine learning models with this particular data set.\n",

    "Sure enough, the bars are the same size; thus, I have built a single tree decision classifier whose accuracy score exactly matches that of my random tree classifier. However, neither model's accuracy is as high as my logistic regression model's accuracy. The logistic regression model does \"need\" a larger set of input features to make its highest accuracy predictions; the single tree and random forest models both max out their accuracy scores with a comparatively smaller set of features. However, since deciding with the highest accuracy possible what is benign and what is malignant is crucial to breast cancer detection and treatment, a logistic regression model seems to be the best choice of machine learning models I've tried so far for this particular data set. There is one caveat to that: Since the data set is small, and the test/validation set is even smaller, it's possible that shuffling a few cells between the training and test/validation sets could impact model performance and therefore my overall conclusions. That would be interesting to investigate in a future (very small) project."

    "I revisited the Scikit-Learn breast cancer data set and fit to that data a series of single decision tree classification and random forest classification models. The most accurate models I was able to construct had just four input features -- \"worst radius\", \"worst area\", \"worst concavity\", and \"worst concave points\" -- and achieved accuracy scores of 95.6%. This is a lower accuracy than the logistic regression model that I built for the same data set was able to achieve. Thus I conclude that, at least for this splitting of data between the training and test/validation sets, a logistic regression model is the best classification model to fit to the data if the goal is to achieve the highest accuracy possible."

    "As I mentioned above, since the data set is so small the accuracy scores I reported would almost certainly be slightly different if a few cells were shuffled between the training and test/validation sets. Thus, for a slightly different set of training/test cells, one might be able to build a single tree classification model and/or random forest classification model of the data that is more accurate than a logistic regression model. It would be interesting to investigate this further, and at some point I may take that up as a very small project.<br>\n",
    "And of course, as I mentioned in my logistic regression model write-up for this very same data set, the models I constructed in this project should in no way, shape, or form be construed as the best way to tell if a patient has breast cancer given measurements from a fine needle aspirate imaging method. These models were built for the purposes of practicing single tree and random forest classification and have no broader applications other than serving as practice exercises."
