# bc_tree_forest_classification
This is a little project that I did to practice building single tree decision classifiers and random forest classifiers. In it, I revisited the breast cancer data set found in scikit-learn's databases and tried to predict if a cell whose digitized image was analyzed is benign or malignant. I compared my models' results with each other, and with the logistic regression model I did in an earlier project. I was able to build single decision tree and random forest classifiers whose accuracies were 95.6%, but I was unable to improve upon my logistic regression model's accuracy of 97.4%.

This project was done with Python 3.0 and Jupyter Notebook. I used the scikit-learn breast cancer data set, and utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and the scikit-learn packages model_selection, tree, ensemble, and metrics in my analysis. So long as you have Jupyter Notebook and the named packages installed, the project should run on your machine. The project itself has been included as breast_cancer_class_tree_forest.ipynb.
